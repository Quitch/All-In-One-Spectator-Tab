# All-In-One Spectator Tab

Adds two tabs to the spectator player panel: ALL and ALL2.

ALL displays the following:

- Metal income
- Energy income
- Efficiency
- Army count
- Fabber count
- Factory count

ALL2 displays army metal in place of army count. Army metal counts all units and structures owned by a player, not just offensive units.

## FAQ

**Why didn't you include total unit count?**

Because I wanted to avoid having the ALL tab be any wider than the other tabs. I considered total unit count to be the most useless stat and so it was dropped.

**Why does your mod wrap the text when the numbers get big?**

I've tried to ensure this is very unlikely to happen, but because the columns are narrower it _could_ happen. Things will get more cramped though. You can switch to the other tabs still if things get ugly.
