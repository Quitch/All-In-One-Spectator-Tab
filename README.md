# All-In-One Spectator Tab

![alt text](https://i.imgur.com/k5fM6FD.png "All In One Spectator Tab")

Adds two tabs to the spectator player panel: ALL and ALL2.

ALL displays the following:

  - Metal income
  - Energy income
  - Efficiency
  - Army count
  - Fabber count
  - Factory count

ALL2 displays army metal in place of army count. Army metal counts all units and structures owned by a player, not just offensive units.

## FAQ

**Why didn't you include total unit count?**

Because I wanted to avoid having the ALL tab be any wider than the other tabs. I considered total unit count to be the most useless stat and so it was dropped.

**Why does your mod wrap the text when the numbers get big?**

I've tried to ensure this is very unlikely to happen, but because the columns are narrower it *could* happen. Things will get more cramped though. You can switch to the other tabs still if things get ugly.

**Do you support translations?**

No. When you include translations in a Planetary Annihilation client mod, it breaks all other translations in the game. Until this is fixed this mod can't ship with translations.
